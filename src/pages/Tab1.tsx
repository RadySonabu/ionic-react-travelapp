      <div>The province of <b>Albay</b> is located in the <b>Bicol</b> region of the Philippines. It is the capital of Legazpi. The province contains one of the finest scenery in the world, particularly its famous <b>Mayon Volcano</b>, which is renowned for its cone-perfect shape. Mayon is a major tourist attraction and an active stratovolcano.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
       The islands of Albay are characterized by splendid <b>greenness, natural wonders, and glorious beaches</b> along their coast. There is a rich cultural heritage in this province, where many festivals are held throughout the year. In particular, the Magayon Festival pays tribute to the beauty of the Mayon Volcano, which is a major cultural event for the people of Albay. 
       <br></br>
       <br></br>
       In economic terms, Albay is primarily an agricultural area, with <b>rice, coconut, and abaca</b> being some of the main crops. Due to its location on the coast of the province, fishing is also an important sector.</div>
